This repository contains the user interface for the financial planning tool, Model for Financial Analysis of Electric Sector Expansion Plan (FINPLAN). FINPLAN is designed to evaluate financial implications of a medium and long term electric sector expansion plan in a country or a region.

## Introduction

In developing countries, financial constraints are often the most significant obstacle to implementing optimal electricity expansion plans. FINPLAN helps assess the financial viability of plans and projects. It takes into account various financial sources—including export credits, commercial loans, bonds, equity, and modern instruments like swaps—and calculates projected cash flows, balance sheets, financial ratios, and other financial indicators.

## Installation

FINPLAN is only compatible with Windows 10 and later.

To install the necessary dependencies:

1. Go to [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-for-visual-studio-2019).

2. Download the x64 or x86 version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2022 (found in the Other Tools, Frameworks, and Redistributables section), depending on your system architecture.

3. Install the downloaded package and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Documentation

The FINPLAN documentation is being updated, and the first version is accessible on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10968558).

## Self-learning and Training

Self-learning materials for FINPLAN, including lectures, hands-on exercises, and quizzes, are freely available on [OpenLearn](https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/course/view.php?id=13669). Additionally, there are capacity-building events such as the [Energy Modelling Platforms](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com/energy-modelling-platform/) where FINPLAN is regularly taught. 

## Questions and Issues

For troubleshooting model-related issues and discussions, please visit the [Energy Modelling Community Discussion Forum](https://forum.u4ria.org/). 

If you encounter bugs or have new feature ideas, please submit them to the repository's issue tracker. We encourage contributions and discussions to further develop FINPLAN.
